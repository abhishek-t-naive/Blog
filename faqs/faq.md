This section answers some of the questions that are asked to a budding researcher applying to a Graduate or a PhD program. To make my views on these common subjects accessible to everyone, I have spent some time to think and answer them with honesty and put them here. All views are my own. (NOTE: More like an interview of myself, by myself)

### How did you first become interested in research?
I was not introduced to research by virtue of any coursework requirement. Rather, it was out of curiosity that I wanted to find out what exactly is the fuss around Research and how do you come up with something absolutely novel. And I believe, I was at the reight place at the right time with the right people (my first mentor and the group) that I really enjoyed my first experience in a formal research environment. The idea of being responsible for your work, for your decisions, ebing independent in your methods were some of the key takeaways from the my first researach experience. And to the day, I believe that independent research in your early years is a great way of building once character. The shear amount of persistence, hard work, discipline it takes, can be emulated to any other areas of life. Moreover, the fact that you own your work gives you an identity, a presence in the world which most of use seek in our lifetime. 

I believe I have a lot to work on when it comes to the above mentioned qualities and hence would like to continue in the field.
### What did you take back after spending time in different labs and industry?
One great thing about planning a career in Research is that you get to meet some great people from across the globe. I have been blessed with such opportunities on a number of occassions.

### What made you interested in studying the intersection of Machine Learning and Hardware Design?

### What is your long term goal?

### What are the challenges you have faced in the short time you have spent in research? How do you go about solving them?

### What does your ideal MS/PhD program look like? 

### What do you want to acquire from your MS/PhD program? If quantifiable in terms of skills, mention them.

### What do you like to do outside of Science? What fuels your passion?
