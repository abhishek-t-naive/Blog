This section answers some of the questions that are asked to a budding researcher applying to a Graduate or a PhD program. To make my views on these common subjects accessible to everyone, I have spent some time to think and answer them with honesty and put them here. All views are my own. (NOTE: More like an interview of myself, by myself)

### How did you first become interested in research?
Bridging the educational gap between (old) Indian schooling system and the college curriculum was a bit tricky for me. Studying Newton's laws in school to struggling to understand Maxwell's equations in college, I don't think I understood for a while what was happening. We were fed information and we were taking it in with very little scope of questioning. It was not until I got my hands on some projects that I understood the reason why things happen and how, what we study co-relates to it. In one's life, he or she desires to leave an impact, something that people will remember themm for. And it was not until last few days of college that reality sets in, Now what. Searching the answer to this 'Now What', I contemplated on taking up an independent journey of my own. Exploring how does one go on to make a significant impact by thinking differently as to all the men/women who have ever lived on the planet. And that idea of being original or unique is something that most of seek and it stuck with me as well.

### What did you take back after spending time in different labs and industry?
One great thing about planning a career in Research is that you get to meet some great people from across the globe. I have been blessed with such opportunities on a number of occassions.

### What made you interested in studying the intersection of Machine Learning and Hardware Design?

### What is your long term goal?

### What are the challenges you have faced in the short time you have spent in research? How do you go about solving them?

### What does your ideal MS/PhD program look like? 

### What do you want to acquire from your MS/PhD program? If quantifiable in terms of skills, mention them.

### What do you like to do outside of Science? What fuels your passion?
