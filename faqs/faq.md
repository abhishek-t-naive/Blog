This section answers some of the questions that are asked to a budding researcher applying to a Graduate or a PhD program. To make my views on these common subjects accessible to everyone, I have spent some time to think and answer them with honesty and put them here. All views are my own. (NOTE: More like an interview of myself, by myself)

### How did you first become interested in research?

I was not introduced to research by virtue of any coursework requirement. Rather, it was out of curiosity that I wanted to find out what exactly is the fuss around Research and how do you come up with something absolutely novel. And I believe, I was at the reight place at the right time with the right people (my first mentor and the group) that I really enjoyed my first experience in a formal research environment. The idea of being responsible for your work, for your decisions, ebing independent in your methods were some of the key takeaways from the my first researach experience. And to the day, I believe that independent research in your early years is a great way of building once character. The shear amount of persistence, hard work, discipline it takes, can be emulated to any other areas of life. Moreover, the fact that you own your work gives you an identity, a presence in the world which most of use seek in our lifetime. 

I believe I have a lot to work on when it comes to the above mentioned qualities and hence would like to continue in the field.
### What did you take back after spending time in different labs and industry?

One of the important realizations that I had during my time with differnt mentors is the importance of right fit between a professor and a student. I believe that there should a match of research methodology between the two or if not, then there should be freedom to explore new methods. Without this I think it could become extremely irritating for one of the two when things are not going your way (which they will not for majority of time)

### What made you interested in studying the intersection of Machine Learning and Hardware Design?

In my short time working in the domain of computer architecture, I have found myself to be inclined towards Domain Specific architectures rather than working with general purpose computing. I find it quite allruing to work with a specific domain as it allows us to collaborate with peoplel sometimes, totally different from our fields like in the case of DNA sequencing algorithms/architectures where you get to work with people from Biology background.

With the current trends of AI and machine learning applications, there are numberous research directions (like security, automation etc.) which is being explored by researchers across the globe. These applications are going to play a key and even larger roles in our lives in the coming years and hence I find them really interesting to explore and be a part of thie golden era of computer architects. 

### What is your long term goal?

I would like to work as a researcher in my coming years and hence would be interested in obtaining a PhD to understand the methodology and skills required to undertake challenging problems. Later on, I want to have a team of my own (whether in industry or academia), with people from different backgrounds and skillsetts working towards a common goal. I want to venture the area of entrepnuership as well which will fullfill one of my desires of starting off with your idea and seeing it culminate into something valuable.

### What are the challenges you have faced in the short time you have spent in research? How do you go about solving them?

The biggest challenge I have faced in all the problems I have dealt with is the inevitable 'trough' in the journey of solving a problem. I remember being stuck in the 'trough' for days where you go in front of your screen but don't have any idea what to try. All that comes to your mind is the same thing that you tried yesterday, day before yesterday and so on. Lately, I have tried to observe how i get out of such troughs and what i have found helfpul is what i call 'No attention days'. For some time I just leave the thing as it is without worrying about whether it will be solved or not. It has worked for now, but I am sure this strategy will require changes as I progress along the lines.

To me, problem solving in general has a great bit to do with the attitude with which you appraoch the task at hand. I have found that to be a successful problem solver (at graduate, student, professor, manager, president level etc) persistance and different thinking are the key skills required. I believe that I am yet to get more efficient at both the mentioned skills  (persistence: when to know that a particular direction is dead end, so that you don't waste valuable time of yours; thinking differently: understanding whether a particular solution is feasible or not) and hence would like to put myself in more of such uncomfortable situations.

### What does your ideal MS/PhD program look like? 

I would take turns to answer this:

MS: Range of courses to offer with freedom to take them ; some amount of focus on providing teaching opportunities; a significant proportion of time dedicated to a project of their own; good relation with the current industrial needs

PhD: Freedom to take courses with much more empahsis on research output; freedom to collaborate; helping in developing quality research generating habits. As the PhD is more about the advisor advisee relationship, list the type of things you need from prof (http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-commandments/)

### What do you want to acquire from your MS/PhD program? If quantifiable in terms of skills, mention them.

### What do you like to do outside of Science? What fuels your passion?
