This section answers some of the questions that are asked to a budding researcher applying to a Graduate or a PhD program. To make my views on these common subjects accessible to everyone, I have spent some time to think and answer them with honesty and put them here. All views are my own. (NOTE: More like an interview of myself, by myself)

### How did you first become interested in research?

I was not introduced to research by virtue of any coursework requirement. Rather, it was out of curiosity that I wanted to find out what exactly is the fuss around Research and how do you come up with something absolutely novel. And I believe, I was at the reight place at the right time with the right people (my first mentor and the group) that I really enjoyed my first experience in a formal research environment. The idea of being responsible for your work, for your decisions, ebing independent in your methods were some of the key takeaways from the my first researach experience. And to the day, I believe that independent research in your early years is a great way of building once character. The shear amount of persistence, hard work, discipline it takes, can be emulated to any other areas of life. Moreover, the fact that you own your work gives you an identity, a presence in the world which most of use seek in our lifetime. 

I believe I have a lot to work on when it comes to the above mentioned qualities and hence would like to continue in the field.
### What did you take back after spending time in different labs and industry?

One of the important realizations that I had during my time with differnt mentors is the importance of right fit between a professor and a student. I believe that there should a match of research methodology between the two or if not, then there should be freedom to explore new methods. Without this I think it could become extremely irritating for one of the two when things are not going your way (which they will not for majority of time)

### What made you interested in studying the intersection of Machine Learning and Hardware Design?

In my short time working in the domain of computer architecture, I have found myself to be inclined towards Domain Specific architectures rather than working with general purpose computing. I find it quite allruing to work with a specific domain as it allows us to collaborate with peoplel sometimes, totally different from our fields like in the case of DNA sequencing algorithms/architectures where you get to work with people from Biology background.

With the current trends of AI and machine learning applications, there are numberous research directions (like security, automation etc.) which is being explored by researchers across the globe. These applications are going to play a key and even larger roles in our lives in the coming years and hence I find them really interesting to explore and be a part of thie golden era of computer architects. 

### What is your long term goal?

### What are the challenges you have faced in the short time you have spent in research? How do you go about solving them?

### What does your ideal MS/PhD program look like? 

### What do you want to acquire from your MS/PhD program? If quantifiable in terms of skills, mention them.

### What do you like to do outside of Science? What fuels your passion?
