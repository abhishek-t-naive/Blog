This section answers some of the questions that are asked to a budding researcher applying to a Graduate program. To make my views on these common subjects accessible to everyone, I have spent some time to think and answer them with honesty and put them here. (NOTE: More like an interview of myself, by myself)

### <a name="q1"></a>How did you first become interested in research and What aspects of it stands out for you?

I was not introduced to research by virtue of any coursework requirement. Rather, it was out of curiosity that I wanted to find out what exactly is the fuss around research and how do you come up with something absolutely novel. I believe, I was at the right place at the right time with the right people (my first mentor and the group) that I really enjoyed my first experience in a formal research environment. The idea of being responsible for your work, for your decisions, being independent in your methods were some of the key takeaways from my first researach experience. And to the day, I believe that independent research in your early years is a great way of building once character. The shear amount of persistence, hard work, discipline it takes, can be emulated to any other areas of life. Moreover, the fact that you own your work gives you an identity, a presence in the world which most of use seek in our lifetime. 

I believe I have a lot to work on when it comes to the above mentioned qualities and hence would like to continue in the field.
### <a name="q2"></a>What did you take back after spending time in different labs and industry?

One of the important realizations that I had during my time with differnt mentors is the importance of right fit between a professor and a student. I believe that there should a match of research methodology between the two or if not, then there should be freedom to explore new methods. Without this I think it could become extremely irritating for one of the two when things are not going your way (which they will not for majority of time)

### <a name="q3"></a>What made you interested in studying the intersection of Machine Learning and Hardware Design?

In my short time working in the domain of computer architecture, I have found myself to be inclined towards Domain Specific architectures rather and not so much with general purpose computing. I find it quite alluring to work with a specific domain as it allows you to gain expertise in an area which may or may not be related to your background hence giving an opportunity to expand on your knowledge base and in the process enabling the transfer of technology to variety of areas. For example working on accelerating DNA Sequencing algorithms brings together people from Biological Sciences and Computer Sciences background together helping out in unraveling the mystery of large human genome.

And the domain in demand right now is that of AI and machine learning. Like most of the other applications of past, being a computer architect puts us in the driving seat to enable the transfer of cool technologies and algorithms to the consumers in an power and cost efficient manner. The notion of not being in the limelight, when it comes to the hype around AI & ML, has kind off a 'romantic' side to it, where you just sit back, away from all the noise and see your work improve the life of common people.

These applications are going to play a key and even larger roles in our lives in the coming years and hence I find them really interesting to explore and be a part of this golden era of computer architects.)

### <a name="q4"></a>What is your long term goal?

I would like to work as a researcher in my coming years and hence would be interested in obtaining a PhD to understand the methodology and skills required to undertake challenging problems. Later on, I want to have a team of my own (either in industry or academia), with people from different backgrounds and skillsetts working towards a common goal. I want to venture the area of entrepnuership as well which will fullfill one of my desires of starting off with your idea and seeing it culminate into something valuable.

### <a name="q5"></a>What are the challenges you have faced in the short time you have spent in research? How do you go about solving them?

The biggest challenge I have faced in all the problems I have dealt with is the inevitable 'trough' in the journey of solving a problem. I remember being stuck in the 'trough' for days where you go in front of your screen but don't have any idea what to try. All that comes to your mind is the same thing that you tried yesterday, day before yesterday and so on. Lately, I have tried to observe how i get out of such troughs and what i have found helfpul is what i call 'No attention days'. For some time I just leave the thing as it is without worrying about whether it will be solved or not. It has worked for now, but I am sure this strategy will require changes as I progress along the lines.

To me, problem solving in general has a great bit to do with the attitude with which you appraoch the task at hand. I have found that to be a successful problem solver (at graduate, student, professor, manager, president level etc) persistance and different thinking are the key skills required. I believe that I am yet to get more efficient at both the mentioned skills  (persistence: when to know that a particular direction is dead end, so that you don't waste valuable time of yours; thinking differently: understanding whether a particular solution is feasible or not) and hence would like to put myself in more of such uncomfortable situations.

### <a name="q6"></a>What does your ideal MS/PhD program look like? 

I would take turns to answer this separately:

MS: An ideal MS program should start off by having an amalgamation of range of courses along with freedom to take them and significant emphasis on research. Other than this, it would be a great plus if there are teaching opportunites provided to the studentsas as it will be a great experience to see the teaching envrionment/setup from the other side. Coupled with all this, the university program should be in accordance with the needs of the industry of present and future. 

PhD: Even though the aim of a PhD is to focus more on your research, I would still prefer to have a range of courses available to me so as to build a good foundation for the tough journey ahead. If the university has a great structure in place for collaborations across the departments and/or with other universities, it can help a PhD student to broaden their perspective. Since the PhD is more about a advisor-advisee relationship, I would love to have a advisor who can introdcue me to academic community say through conference talks, invited talks etc. Considering the extensive work involved in a PhD, I think it will be a huge plus if an advisor can provide protection from and information about funding concerns along with providing early and clear guidance about the time frames and conditions for graduation.

### <a name="q7"></a>What do you want to acquire from your MS/PhD program? If quantifiable in terms of skills, mention them.

Even though the extent of research done in an MS or PhD program is not comparable, but for me either of the programs should serve a common purpose, which is to help a researcher learn how to do research. This would mean identifying what are the next-big problems in a particular area, knowing when it is time to start on a topic and when to get out of one. This in a nutshell can separate good researchers from the quality ones.

Having worked for over 2.5 years now in Industry and Academia, going back to studying will give me a fresher perspective towards learning. While working you get to understand what elements of your classroom learning are most vital when you are working on real world problems. Going back to studying, I want to make it much more effective and targetted as per my ambitions, strengths and weaknesses

### <a name="q8"></a>What do you like to do outside of Science[CHANGE THIS]? What fuels your passion?

As I have grown up over the years I have seen myself inclined towards forming a lifestyle supporting 'Generalism' rather than trying to be a 'Specialist'. I feared it for a while that I am just wasting my time and should focus on absolutely one thing to taste some success. But I have come to favor the strategy of trying to learn different new things irrespective of whether they do or do not complement each other Of course, with a right balance!).

My current ventures include learning French and working on obtaining my FMSCI license so that I can give a shot to my ever lingering desire to drive cars fast and do a hand-brake turn in a slick manner. In future, or as an one of on going efforts I would like to be much more consistent with my writing as I lack sometimes coheiveness in my thoughts.

### <a name="q9"></a>How will you describe your academic performance in Undergraduate? Any reasons for not scoring higher?

One of the primary requirements of getting into a good Graduate program is the academic record in one's undergrad. I scored an aggregrate of 74.37 % (or 8.2 CGPA) over 8 semesters which can not be considered great for admission process. For me the journey of first semester was the toughest one where I scored my lowest. Unfortunately, the semester exam collided with the time my mother was hospitilized with dengue fever and my father being in military services was not around the entire time. So being the single child, it was down to me to take care of my mother for a period of 10 days which included coming back from the hospital at 10 or so in the night, sleeping and waking up at 3 in the morning to study for the next day exam. Luckily, my mother recovered from the fever and I got the opportunity to balance my score for the first year in the second semester where I scored 79.6% and was ranked 3rd in a batch of 148 students.

With some decent performances over the next few semester, I could maintain a good percentage but with my interest slowly going away from core Electrical (which our curriculum was focused on to a great extent) I started loosing interest and my performance declined in the last few semesters. Looking back at it now, I can say that it was a mixture of our curiculum in DTU, where courses were given huge priority and that too with no freedom whatsoever to choose what you want to study. I remeber in the last two semesters having 4 theoretical classes along with 3-4 labs. I don't want to sound like one of those graduates who blame it on the college for lack of, anything, in their profile but this is what I can observe looking back at it after 3 years.

To show my academic potential, I have courses like Digital Design in which I score second highest, couple this with courses in Network Analysis and Synthesis which involved a great bit of mathematics and I could score in higher 80's. Since, we did not have relative grading system until and unless we score in high 80's or 90's all other scores seems low. THat was the case with Microcontrollers course where I score in 60's but it is the infamous course in our curriculum where no body has ever been able to score more than 80 and that year i think the highest marks were in low 70's. These were the courses that I found interesting and relevant to what I want to do ahead. When I could not find any more relevant courses in the curiculum I had to look for options like edx.org and Coursera to suffice my knowledge.

In short (phew!), the acamdemic scores don't seem high enough because of me loosing interests in the core electrical subjects in last few semesters,
