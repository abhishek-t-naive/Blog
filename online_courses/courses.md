I am a believer in the abilities of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC's) to globalize quality education. Over the years, I have tried to improve my understanding of fundamentals of Computer Science and Engineering through some of the great courses taught around the world. Here, I am putting up all the courses I have taken along the years on platforms like Coursera, edx along with the topics covered in those courses and my final grade (information which is not present on the certificates and is one of the major reasons why MOOCs are doubted by a lot of people across the globe).
