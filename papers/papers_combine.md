I like to follow the approach mentioned [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/teaching/EE382V-Fall2010/review.html) by Dr. Miryung Kim for reviewing research articles. Here I have compiled some of the reviews that I have done in the domain of System Design for Machine Learning Applications:

## Open Source Toolsets
Collection of some work done towards developing Simulation-Emulation, Performance and Energy Efficiency measuring toolsets for HW accelerator designs

1. SCALE-Sim: Systolic CNN	Accelerator Simulator [[Review](/Blog/papers/open_source_tools/2019-07-18-Tools-Scale-Sim.html)]
2. Aladdin: A Pre-RTL, Power-Performance Accelerator Simulator Enabling Large Design Space Exploration of Customized Architectures [[Review](/Blog/papers/open_source_tools/2019-07-23-Tools-Aladdin.html)]
3. Spatial: A Language and Compiler for Application Accelerators [[Review](/Blog/papers/open_source_tools/2019-07-26-Lang-Spatial.html)]
