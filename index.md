Welcome to my webpage. My name is Abhishek Tyagi. I am a First Year CS PhD student at the Univeristy of Rochester. I was previously a Hardware Engineer working with Samsung Research & Development Institute, Bangalore India.

My [research interest](/Blog/research_int/Refined_Research Interest.html) lies in Computer Architecture with current emphasis on designing efficient systems for emerging applications like Deep Neural Networks, Genomic Sequencing etc. In my pursuit of getting acquainted with various approaches taken towards hardware accelerators for machine learning workloads, I have reviewed a few articles and have been keeping their short-summaries (reviews) [here](/Blog/papers/papers_combine). 

You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bkYOe5VFJ7Pntmh2QO5YDnuD6rYPlXiQ/view?usp=sharing)(last updated: Jun 2020)
