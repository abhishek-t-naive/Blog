Welcome to my webpage. I am Abhishek Tyagi, a Hardware Engineer working with Samsung Research & Development Institute, Bangalore India. Presently we are working towards developing the next generation of face recognition chips to be employed in Samsung's handheld devices.

My research interest lies in Acceleration of the Neural Networks, with primary focus towards HW/SW Co-Design approach. In my pursuit of getting acquainted with various approaches taken towards hardware accelerators for ML workloads, I have reviewed a few articles and have been keeping their short-summaries (reviews) [here]().
